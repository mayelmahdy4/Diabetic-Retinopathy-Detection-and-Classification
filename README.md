# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-and-Classification
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that can result in vision loss or blindness if not identified early. This project develops an automated deep learning system to detect and classify DR severity using retina images preprocessed with Gaussian filters and resized to 224Ã—224 pixels. We employed two pre-trained models, VGG16 and EfficientNetB0, trained and validated on the APTOS 2019 dataset, to categorize images into five DR stages: No_DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferate_DR. To address class imbalance, we implemented data weighting and oversampling techniques, enhancing model performance. Evaluation using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices highlights the efficacy of these models, showcasing the potential of AI in supporting ophthalmologists for early and precise DR diagnosis.
